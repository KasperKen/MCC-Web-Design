            Web pages are used extensively in day to day life, Unfortunately those web pages do not simply come into being out of thin air. A web developer has to create those pages to display the desired content in exactly the way it needs to be displayed. Without web developers the internet as we know it would not exist.

            As a nice bonus Web Developer can be a rewarding (and lucritive) career.
