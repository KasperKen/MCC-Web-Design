    <h2 class="headcenter">About</h2>
    <p class="center">Learning a new skill is hard enough as is without having to scour through limitless irrelevant informatiscattered accross the web. You want to do one thing for a project, and 3 hours later you are reading through countless manuels written by autists who assume everyone is as knowlegable as them. On the other hand, having information spood fed to you like a toddler is no fun either. I set out to walk the line and create easy to follow guides that deliver all the information you need without skipping over important aspects, or assuming you don't have a working brain. </p><br>
