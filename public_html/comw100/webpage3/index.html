    <h2>HTML Tags</h2>
    
    <p>I have always thought HTML was a coding language. However this isn't the case. HTML is markup language which only exists to format documents in a way that a web browser can read and display. In simpler terms it is a formatting language. Each tag used is merely a way for the browser to format particular text or images into human readable blocks. They also allow web crawlers, and assistive technologies to better parse through the information.</p>
    
    <p>For example the &lt;head&gt; tag containes information important to the document such as the meta title information, each of which would be it's own tag whithin the header brackets. The &lt;title&gt; tag for example contains the title of the webpage to be crawled by search engines, and be displayed in the title bar.
            
    <p>The &lt;body&gt; tag contains all the information which will be displayed in the body of the website. This is the actual web content such headings and paragraphes which can be broken into their own tags &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, and &lt;p&gt;. Another important thing to note is that all tags need an opening and closing tag. To open a tag you would use brackets to declare a tag, and then brackets with a forward slash to indicate that you are closing the tag.</p>
            
    <p>For Example:<br><br>&lt;p&gt;<br>This is a paragraph<br>&lt;/p&gt;</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Some other examples of common tags may include:</p>
         
    <ul>
      <li>&lt;hr&gt; creates a horizontal line to create a break in the page, such as the one above this text.</li>
      <li>&lt;br&gt; creates line breaks thus breaking the text into more human readable blocks on the display.</li>
      <li>&lt;ul&gt; creates an unordered list, such as the one being used here</li>
      <li>&lt;ol&gt; creates an ordered list</li>
      <li>&lt;li&gt; structures content in a list within a ul, or ol element</li>
    </ul>
